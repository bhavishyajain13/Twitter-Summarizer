# Twitter-Summarizer
This project creates an NLP tool for extracting insights from Twitter data, overcoming challenges posed by the vast and diverse content. It identifies keywords, topics, and sentiment, applicable to social media monitoring, brand management, and opinion analysis.

Summary:
Summarization is the process of representing a text document with desired length of text that
retains the most important points of the original document. A summary includes original
sentences or reinterpreted sentences from the source document. Twitter topic summarization
task is to produce a summary of a topic with desired number of tweets.
Most of the Twitter topic summarization approaches are based on conventional summarization
techniques formerly applied on traditional text documents like newswire text. These algorithms
modified accordingly to deal with the challenges of informal text like tweets. Twitter topic
summarization approaches can be categorized into two ways: one, based on summary content
and another based on event category. Content based approaches again classified into two types:
extractive (Extr.) and abstractive (Abstr.) summaries, event category-based approaches is also
classified into two types: generic (Gen.) and domain specific (Dom.) summaries.


Dataset:
Each tweet in the dataset includes various attributes, such as the tweet text, author name,
date and time of creation, number of likes, retweets, and replies.
To prepare the dataset for summarization, we performed several preprocessing steps,
including removing URLs, mentions, and hashtags, as well as stop words and special
characters. We also applied tokenization and stemming techniques to further clean the
text and reduce redundancy. It is important to note that the dataset is not representative
of the entire Twitter population, and may be subject to biases and limitations. For
example, the tweets in the dataset may be skewed towards a specific demographic or
geographic region, and may not capture the full range of opinions and sentiments on the
given topic.Despite these limitations, the dataset provides a useful starting point for
summarizing Twitter data, and can help us gain insights into the patterns and trends of
Twitter conversations related to the chosen topic.

Conclusion:
Summarizing Twitter data can provide valuable insights into public opinion, sentiment, and trends on a
wide range of topics. Using various techniques such as natural language processing, machine learning, and
data visualization, we can extract meaningful information from vast amounts of Twitter data. Whether it is
for business, marketing, or research purposes, summarizing Twitter data can help us understand and make
informed decisions based on the pulse of the online community. However, it is important to acknowledge
the limitations and challenges of working with social media data, including biases, data quality issues, and
ethical considerations. Overall, summarizing Twitter data is a powerful tool that can yield valuable insights
when approached with the right methods and consideration.
